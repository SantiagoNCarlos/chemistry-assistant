# Alfred Nobel - Chemistry Assistant
## About
Alfred Nobel is a simple conversational assistant developed as a final project for a course I took at University. Powered by Rasa, the aim of this project is to provide a resourceful tool for students to assist in their learning of chemistry outside the classroom.

## Features
It's capable of giving simple explanations of the following chemistry topics: Atomic Radius, Stoichiometry, Lewis Structure, Covalent Bond, and Ionic Bond. It can provide users with examples, exercises, and video content related to these topics. It's also capable of detecting a few emotions in the user, like happiness, anger or sadness, and answer to their requests accordingly.

The assistant is designed to understand and interact in Spanish. It was originally created using Rasa 2.0, and has been updated to be compatible with Rasa 3.1.
